                <h2>Benefits of Feeling Good</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Positive emotions balance out negative ones, but they have other powerful benefits, too.<br>                
                    Instead of narrowing our focus like negative emotions do, positive emotions affect our brains in ways that increase our awareness, attention, and memory. 
                    They help us take in more information, hold several ideas in mind at once, and understand how different ideas relate to each other.<br>
                    When positive emotions open us up to new possibilities, we are more able to learn and build on our skills. <br>That leads to doing better on tasks and tests.
                    People who have plenty of positive emotions in their everyday lives tend to be happier, healthier, learn better, and get along well with others.</p>
